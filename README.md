# TA-stat420
This repository contains the assignments and project of STAT 420 in summer 2017.

The `Rmd` files may not be exactly same as the codes which are provided by instructor David Unger, such as `ggplot`, etc. The `Python` files are the corresponding ones of `Rmd` files. The outputs should not be the same since we R and Python have different methodss to generate random numbers.

The basic language of this assignment is `R` (language of the course) and `Python 2` (extracurricular coding).

The newest one will be uploaded after the corresponding assignment is due.
