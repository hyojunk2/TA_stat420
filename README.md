# TA-stat420
## Introduction
This repository contains the assignments and project of STAT 420 in summer 2017.

The `.Rmd` files may not be exactly same as the codes which are provided by instructor David Unger, such as `ggplot`, etc. The `.py` files are the corresponding ones of `.Rmd` files. The outputs should not be the same since we R and Python have different methods to generate random numbers.

## Programming Language
The basic language of this assignment is `R` (language of the course) and `Python 2` (extracurricular coding).

## Timeline
The newest `.Rmd` file will be uploaded after the corresponding assignment is due. The newest `.py` file will be uploaded immediately after being finished.
