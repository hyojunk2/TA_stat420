# TA-stat420
## Introduction
This repository contains the assignments and project of STAT 420 in summer 2017.

The `.Rmd` files may not be exactly same as the codes which are provided by instructor David Unger, such as `ggplot`, etc. The `.py` files are the corresponding ones of `.Rmd` files. The outputs should not be exactly the same since R and Python have different methods to generate random numbers.

### function.py

Compared with R, Python like `sklearn` will only be able to provide very few measures. Hence, Mr. Wenke Huang created this file which will help fit `Linear Regression` model with useful outputs that are similar with R's by himself.

When we try to perform this model packages, only models that are created by using Linear_Regression() from this model work. Currently, it does not support models from `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`. Possible improvements and `Logistic Regression` are on their way!

## Programming Language
The basic language of this assignment is `R` (language of the course) and `Python` (extracurricular coding).

From HW01 to HW06, the programming language is `Python 2.7`. The language of HW07 and HW08 is `Python 3.6`. This is a transfer from `Python 2.7` to `Python 3.6` because of the new version getting more and more popular and famous.

## Timeline
The newest `.Rmd` file will be uploaded after the corresponding assignment is due. The newest `.py` file will be uploaded immediately after being finished.
